# TODO
- tweak marker merging algorithm to look more visually pleasing
- develop scalable way to load in featured project data as markers and tooltips (will be similar to how designer data is mapped currently)
- guide for future maintainers of the project
- make sure code is supported on all browsers (maybe not IE?)
