# TODO
- develop scalable way to load in featured project data as markers and tooltips (will be similar to how designer data is mapped currently)
- guide for future maintainers of the project
- make sure code is supported on all browsers (maybe not IE?)
- how to handle cases where it is impossible to split a group on all zoom levels meaning some info is never viewable
- proper documentation (docstrings, etc.)
- replace custom-made functionality that Leaflet already has built in (distance between two points, etc.)? 
- 2 space indents (JS convention)
- explain what the marker clustering algorithm is doing in the comments
- more robust system for fallback map tile providers
- cite code sources
- keep commits smaller
- test on various devices
