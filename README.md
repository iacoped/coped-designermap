# TODO / Suggestions
- Refactor CSS to be more readable, maintainable
- Proper explanation of what markerManager.computeMarkerState() is doing
- make sure code is supported on all browsers
- ensure page looks good on various devices
- better browser tab icon
- make tooltip size scale better with different device sizes 
- Dynamic max zoom level instead of hardcoded value (basically, if a marker does not have space to split at the max zoom level, increase the max zoom level until it has enough space)
- 2 space indents (JS convention)
- more robust system for fallback map tile providers
- Popups could stay visible when zoom level changes, location simply moves with the person's new location
- tweak how fast marker radius grows so doesn't look bad if dataset grows
- If tile fails to load, switch to geojson completely so doesn't look inconsistent?
- check for memory leaks
