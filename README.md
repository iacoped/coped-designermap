# TODO
- guide for future maintainers of the project
- make sure code is supported on all browsers (maybe not IE?)
- how to handle cases where it is impossible to split a group on all zoom levels meaning some info is never viewable
- proper documentation (docstrings, etc.)
- 2 space indents (JS convention)
- explain what the marker clustering algorithm is doing in the comments
- more robust system for fallback map tile providers
- cite code sources
- keep commits smaller
- test on various devices
- popup stays visible even when zooming in, just moves to correct location?
- tweak starting view on mobile so looks better
- tweak how fast marker radius grows so doesn't look bad if dataset grows
- maybe if tile fails to load, switch to geojson completely so doesn't look inconsistent
- check for memory leaks?
- make tooltip scrollable if exceeds certain height
- choose content of title tag
